# Phase 5: DM Features — Overview

> **Timeline:** Weeks 9-10 | **Epics:** 33-38 | **Stories:** 27 | **Tasks:** ~135 | **New Components:** ~35+

## Summary

Phase 5 delivers a complete Dungeon Master toolkit for D&D Character Forge. Campaign CRUD with house rules and invite codes, a party dashboard with at-a-glance stats grid and skill/language matrices, a full combat/initiative tracker with turn cycling and NPC/monster support, DM-only character notes, a campaign session log, an NPC tracker, a loot/reward tracker, and XP/milestone level-up distribution — all while maintaining the local-first IndexedDB architecture.

**Phase 4 Dependencies:** Phase 5 assumes all Phase 4 session play features are complete — dice roller, HP tracker, spell slot tracker, conditions tracker, rest automation, and level-up flow. The DM features build on these by orchestrating them across multiple characters simultaneously (party HP, group initiative, party-wide XP awards, etc.).

## Pre-Phase Audit Notes

### Gap D1 — Local DM Role Model (No Authentication)

The app is local-first with no user accounts. Resolution: the user who creates a campaign is the DM by definition. Characters added to a campaign are always from the local IndexedDB. Players "join" by importing a character JSON into the DM's app, or by the DM creating a placeholder character. The `dmId` field is set to a locally generated persistent user ID stored in the preferences table. This is a single-device DM-centric workflow.

### Gap D2 — Campaign-Character Relationship

A character can be in zero or one campaign at a time. The same character cannot be in two campaigns simultaneously. Removing a character from a campaign unlinks but does not delete. Deleting a campaign unlinks all characters without deleting them.

### Gap D3 — HouseRules Interface

Defined for Phase 5 with fields: `allowedSources`, `abilityScoreMethod`, `startingLevel`, `startingGold`, `hpMethod`, `allowFeats`, `allowMulticlass`, `encumbranceRule`, `criticalHitRule`, `customNotes`.

### Gap D4 — SessionNote Interface

Defined for Phase 5 with fields: `id`, `sessionNumber`, `date`, `title`, `summary`, `npcsEncountered`, `locationsVisited`, `lootAwarded`, `xpAwarded`, `milestoneLevel`, `tags`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

### Gap D5 — Combatant Model for Initiative Tracker

Lightweight combatant model: `id`, `name`, `type` (player/npc/monster), `characterId`, `initiativeRoll`, `initiativeModifier`, `armorClass`, `hitPointMax`, `hitPointCurrent`, `tempHitPoints`, `conditions`, `notes`, `isVisible`, `groupId`.

### Gap D6 — Encounter Data Model

Defined: `id`, `campaignId`, `sessionId`, `name`, `combatants`, `currentTurnIndex`, `roundNumber`, `isActive`, `xpBudget`, `notes`, `createdAt`.

### Gap D7 — Party Role Mapping

Class-to-role mapping for composition analysis. Roles: Tank/Defender, Melee Striker, Ranged Striker, Healer/Support, Controller, Utility/Skill Monkey, Face (Social). Analysis is informational, not prescriptive.

### Gap D8 — Join Codes as Local Import Mechanism

Without a backend, join codes work as a local import mechanism: DM generates a 6-char code tied to a campaign export. Players import the campaign metadata JSON. True sharing is via JSON export/import. This scaffolding pattern matches the future backend-enabled flow.

**Test Distribution:** Unit 31% / Functional 50% / E2E 19% — aligns with Phase 5 target of Functional (50%) + E2E (40% of integration coverage)

### Testing Infrastructure Needed
- **Mock Database**: fake-indexeddb for Dexie.js testing; in-memory IndexedDB for store and hook tests
- **SRD Data Fixtures**: Monster index (subset: Goblin, Orc, Dragon), magic item data, CR-to-XP mapping table, XP threshold table, language reference (8 Common + 8 Exotic)
- **Campaign Fixtures**: Empty campaign, campaign with 4 characters, campaign with 8+ characters, archived campaign, campaign with full data (sessions, encounters, NPCs, loot)
- **Character Fixtures**: Characters at various levels and XP thresholds, casters and non-casters, characters with conditions/temp HP, characters near death, level 20 characters
- **Encounter Fixtures**: Active encounter mid-combat, encounter with grouped monsters, encounter with lair actions, completed encounter with XP summary
- **Mock Phase 4 Dependencies**: Dice roller (deterministic), HP tracker logic, conditions system, death save logic, spell slot tracker, rest automation, level-up flow
- **Mock UI Utilities**: Debounce timer mocks, drag-and-drop testing utilities, framer-motion animation mocks, file input mocks for JSON import
- **Context Providers**: DMContextProvider mock (isDMView flag), React Router mock with params, Zustand store mocks for campaign, encounter, and character stores
- **Shared Test Utilities**: XP calculation helpers (shared between Epic 35 and 37), campaign export/import validation helpers, join code generation/validation helpers
